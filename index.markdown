    excerpt: "\"Living with Duchenne is an unimaginable burden for families. Parents face the heartbreak of watching their child lose abilities, while boys with Duchenne grapple with fear, frustration, and isolation.<br>The emotional toll is relentless, yet mental health support remains almost nonexistent. That's why every pound you raise is vital. Through our Harrison's Fund 'CHRYSALIS GRANTS', we provide life-changing Clinical Psychology sessions - giving families the strength to cope, the space to grieve, and the tools to keep moving forward.<br>Your generosity means parents don’t have to face this alone, and boys with Duchenne can find hope in the darkest moments. Thank you for making this possible.\"<br>- Alex Smith, Chief Executive and Harrison's Dad"
